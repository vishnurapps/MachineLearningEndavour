All In 
******
This is used when we have prior knowledge about the topic and we know that all independent 
variables have influence in dependend variable.
 
Backward Elimination
********************

This method include 5 steps

Step 1 : Select a significant level to stay in the model, lets say SL = 0.05
Step 2 : Fit the model with all possible predectors
Step 3 : Consider the predector with highest p value. If the value is greater than SL, 
         go to Step 4 else go to FIN
Step 4 : Remove that predector
Step 5 : Fit the model without the removed variable. Go to step 3
FIN : Model is ready
