Random force is a version of ensemble learning. Ensemble learning is when you take multiple algorithms 
or the same algorithm multiple times and you put them together to make something much more powerful 
than the original. Out of all the data points we have, we are going to take K data points and 
we will build a decision tree based on that. In Random Forest Regression, we will plot so many 
decision trees and to predict the result, we will take the average of the prediction of all these 
decision trees
