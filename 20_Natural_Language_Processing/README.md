# Natural Language Processing
NLP is a way for computers to analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way. 
By utilizing NLP, developers can organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks such as automatic summarization, 
translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic 
segmentation.

## Dataset used for NLP

For NLP, we prefer using the tsv (tab seperated values) file. This is because in most of the data written by humans,
say a review of some kind, there is a high chance of writing a comma than a tab.
